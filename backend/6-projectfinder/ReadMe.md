#### Installation Guide for ProjectFinder Service (Django)

- <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Using your file explorer, go inside the directory `backend\6-projectfinder`, copy the `example.env` file and paste it in the same folder. Rename the copied environment file to `.env`. Open the `.env` file and update the value of `<change_password>` in the `NEO4J_HOST` variable.

- Open a command prompt/terminal in the `backend\6-projectfinder` directory with **administration rights**

- Install and activate python virtual environment for Windows

  - Type the following commands to install and activate the virtual environment:

    - Install python virtual environment

      ```bash
      pip install pipenv
      ```

    - Install python package

      ```bash
      pipenv install
      ```

    - Activate the virtual environment

      ```bash
      pipenv shell
      ```

      **(Optional)** To check the location of your Python virtual environment, type the following command in your command prompt

      ```bash
      pipenv --venv
      ```

- Run the `migrations`. Delete the db.sqlite3 file if it exists - it will be created again after the migrations are run successfully. You will only need to run the migrations when you made changes to the relational database models.

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- Run the `django` server

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
